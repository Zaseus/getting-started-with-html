  <p><b>What is the Web?</b><br><br>
The web is comprised of three main things. The <em>Browser</em>, <em>Internet</em>, and <em>Servers</em>.In essence, the web is a lot of computers talking to one another. A person sends
  an <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em> which then returns the requested information.
  <em>HTTP</em> (which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is comparable to the highways that connect cities to one another.The <em>Browser</em> is the indvidual machine that connects to the network
    or the <em>Internet</em> and sends requests to the <em>Server</em>
</p>
<br>
<p><b>HTML?</b><br><br>
HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. It is  what gives form and function to 
web pages. it's made up of two things, <em>Text content</em> and <em>Markup</em>.
<em>Text Contet</em> makes up what you see in a webpage (content) while <em>Markup</em> decides how that content looks.

<br>
<p><b>Elements and Tags</b><br>
<br>
An <em>Element</em> refers to that which is everything between an opening and closing <em>Tag</em>. There are two types of Elements, <em>Inline</em> and <em>Block</em>. 
Inline is an Element that just makes a line. An example wold be < br >, < br > is a void tag that moves to the next line, or sometimes referred to as a Break.
A Block Element creates an invisible Box that has specific height and width restrictions. < p > is a block Element called paragraph.
  A <em>Tag</em> is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (< p >) followed by a closing tag (< /p >).
    There are some called <em>Void Tags</em> that do not require closing tags.<br><br>
    Some of the more commonly used tags are as follows:<br>
    < b > < /b > - The <b>Bold</b> tag<br>
    < em > < /em > - The <em>Italics</em> tag<br>
    < a > < /a > - This is the anchor tag.<br>
    The anchor tag is used to place <em>Hyper Links</em> or <em>Links</em> in the content of a webpage. < a href="www.reddit.com"> derp< /a > is an example of what can be used to insert
    a link in a page. It shows up as <a href="www.reddit.com">derp</a>. (href) is the atrribute that is being assigned to the anchor.

  <p><b>Computers are Smiple</b><br>
  <br>
  Computers follow directions that they are <em>given</em> and that is <u>all</u> that they can do.
  They cannot interpret what a person means, only what they explicitly and definitely tell it to do.
  When someone refers to a computer being simple  or stupid. They are referring to (usually) an error that has occurred.
  The <em>Syntax</em> or rules of the language (HTML in this case) have to be followed precisely if we want it to work as intended.
  <em>Syntax</em> is like Grammar.
